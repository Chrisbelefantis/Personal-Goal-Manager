# Introduction

This application is a tool that will help you keep track of your goals. The aim of the project first of all was to use it
myself, but down the road I decided to add authentication and share with my friends trying to motivate them towards setting
goals and personal development. Also it was a very good opportunity for me to make use of my react knowledge in practical
way.

# Front-End

For the styling I didnt use any framework so I had to first **design the app** and then procceed to the implementation phase.

> The design is **responsive** and **mobile friendly**.

The front-end section is a **Single Page Application (SPA)** builded using the **React** library. 
Some of the packages used are mentioned below:

| Package | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| React Router | In order to implemet the different Routes of the application |
| React Redux | I use Redux store for all the authentication information shared in the components|
| Redux Thunk | For dispatching asynchronous actions |
| Axios | For the http requests at the API |
